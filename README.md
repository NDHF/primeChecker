# primeChecker
A simple JS program for checking prime numbers

* A prime number is an integer divisble by only two numbers: one and itself.
* primeChecker takes a number as an argument, and checks all integers between one and the number itself.
* The modulo operator is used to check for divisibility, by looking for a remainder of zero.
* If the number has no more than two possible divisors, the number is prime.
* If the number has more than two possible divisors, the number is not prime.

# NOTES

* The for-loop begins at 1, because division by zero is not permissible.  

# ADDITIONAL FEATURE IDEAS

* Recursion could probably used to create a program that runs prime factorization of a number.
